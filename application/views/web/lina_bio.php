					<p>
					   After successfully operating over 200 + Preschools and International schools under the brand name of Kangaroo Kids and Billabong High International School, Lina has now ventured into the EDTECH space. Her latest venture is called Korroboree - derived from the Australian word “Corroboree” which is a sacred gathering of people.
					</p>
				   
					<p>
					   Korroboree is a learning emporium for anyone interested in self-discovery and self-mastery, it is an initiative to reach out to those who shape the minds of the young ones. An online space where you can give your child transformational life experiences with the help of the tools and resources available on the platform designed keeping in mind neuroscience, behavioural science, and developing habits of mind works. The aim is to provide greater access to quality learning that will allow each member of the community to become the best version of themselves.

					<p class="bold_txt">How the Journey Began:-</p>
				   
					<p>Lina Ashar did her primary schooling in England before moving to Australia, where she acquired a bachelor’s degree in Education from Melbourne’s, Victoria College. In 1991, she came to India on a year-long sabbatical from college. While connecting with her roots, she landed up taking a teaching stint at a prestigious heritage school in suburban Mumbai, an experience that changed her life and led to the burning question “How can she bring back the joy of childhood for the children in India?”</p>
					
					<p>
					   Back then, the education system in India was still grappling with a straitjacketed approach to education. It was robbing children of their childhood. She was appalled by a lackluster system of education that upheld only the high-flyers. Crammed classrooms, disinterested students, and over-stressed parents inspired her to work on a model of education that was fulfilling, effective, and yet stress-free.
					</p>
					<br>
					
					<p class="bold_txt">Kangaroo Kids and Billabong High International School:-</p>
				  
					<p>
					  The conviction to offer an education that set the child at the centre, began with a preschool in Bandra (Mumbai) in the year 1993 with 25 students. With a successful formula at hand, she went from one preschool (Kangaroo Kids) to a network of them, whilst branching out to high schools (Billabong High International School) as well. The journey of developing child-centric schools across 44+ different cities in India and across Dubai, Maldives, and Qatar has been an outstanding one, supported by parents, education partners, and a fierce team of dedicated, passionate, and determined individuals at the school and central team level. 
					<p>
					<br>
				  
					<p class="bold_txt">Author of two Books:- </p>
					
					<p>
					   In her endeavour to make a difference in every child’s life, she wrote her first book called ‘Who Do you Think You Are Kidding’. The book dealt with parenting for children and is a complete guide for parents on how to build a positive child right from the start. Teenage, as we all know, is the most difficult stage in life and the one where parents and children have the maximum amount of friction. Her second book ‘Drama Teen’, is a guide for both parents and teens.
